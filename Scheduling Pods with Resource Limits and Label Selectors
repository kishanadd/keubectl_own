kubectl describe nodes
The pod YAML for a pod with requests:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resource-pod1
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: "chadcrowell3c.mylabserver.com"
  containers:
  - image: busybox
    command: ["dd", "if=/dev/zero", "of=/dev/null"]
    name: pod1
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 800m
        memory: 20Mi
Create the requests pod:

kubectl create -f resource-pod1.yaml
View the pods and nodes they landed on:

kubectl get pods -o wide
The YAML for a pod that has a large request:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resource-pod2
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: "chadcrowell3c.mylabserver.com"
  containers:
  - image: busybox
    command: ["dd", "if=/dev/zero", "of=/dev/null"]
    name: pod2
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 1000m
        memory: 20Mi
Create the pod with 1000 millicore request:

kubectl create -f resource-pod2.yaml
See why the pod with a large request didn’t get scheduled:

kubectl describe resource-pod2
Look at the total requests per node:

kubectl describe nodes chadcrowell3c.mylabserver.com
Delete the first pod to make room for the pod with a large request:

kubectl delete pods resource-pod1
Watch as the first pod is terminated and the second pod is started:

kubectl get pods -o wide -w
The YAML for a pod that has limits:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: limited-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: busybox
    command: ["dd", "if=/dev/zero", "of=/dev/null"]
    name: main
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 20Mi
Create a pod with limits:

kubectl create -f limited-pod.yaml
Use the exec utility to use the top command:

kubectl exec -it limited-pod top
